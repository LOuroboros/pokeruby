# About this branch

Its name is self-explanatory. This branch had the main goal of adding the Fairy Type as an entirely new type to Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, meaning the Type Mystery is still present.

This research was originally started by Whack a Hack! User [Gorka/Turambar](https://whackahack.com/foro/u-35558/turambar/) the 2 of August from 2018.

As of today, Tuesday 4th of June 2019, the research has been completed thanks to many Whack a Hack users (me included), with the help of Discord User "Shinny" and [BluRose](https://github.com/blurosie).
